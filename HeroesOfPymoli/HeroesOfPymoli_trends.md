# Heroes Of Pymoli Trends
Must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

## Gender Trend
- Males make up 84% of players but also have the lowest average purchase price and average purchase price per person. 
- Females and other/non-disclosed genered players, together making up 16% of players, both have higher average purchase prices and average purchase prices per person than males. 
- This tells us that game marketing may be geared more towards the male demographic. 
- Females and other/non-disclosed gendered players are willing to spend more on average when they do make game related purchases resulting in a higher one-time spend rather than multiple lower spends.

## Age Trend
- Players in the 20-24 age range make up hearly half of all players (258/576 players, 44.79%) and also produced the highest purchase value ($1,114.06). 
- All other age ranges combined accounted for $1,265.71 in revenue out of $2,379.77 in total revenue.
- Players between 20-24 years old made up 45% of players, but generated 47% of revenue ($1,114.06 / $2,379.77).
- The target age range for Heroes of Pymoli should be 15-29 years old, since this range makes up more than 75% of all players (442/576 players).

## Item Trend
- The most popular item is Final Critic (item ID 92) with both the highest purchase count and most revenue (13 purchases, $59.99 total purchase value).
- The second most popular item is Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm (Item ID 178) with the second highest purchase count and second highest revenue (12 purchases, $50.76 total purchase value).
